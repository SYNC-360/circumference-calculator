## Main Calculator Features

### Input Methods

The calculator supports three ways to find circumference:

**1. From Radius (C = 2πr)**
- Most common in geometry
- Formula: Circumference = 2 × π × radius
- Example: If radius = 10 cm, then C = 62.83 cm

**2. From Diameter (C = πd)**
- Direct and intuitive method
- Formula: Circumference = π × diameter
- Example: If diameter = 20 cm, then C = 62.83 cm

**3. From Area (C = 2√(πA))**
- Derived from area formula
- Formula: Circumference = 2 × √(π × area)
- Useful for engineering and land surveying applications
- Example: If area = 314.16 cm², then C = 62.83 cm

## Mathematical Formulas

### Circle Circumference Formulas

**Formula 1: From Radius**
C = 2πr
- C: Circumference
- π: Pi (3.14159...)
- r: Radius

**Formula 2: From Diameter**
C = πd
- C: Circumference
- π: Pi (3.14159...)
- d: Diameter

**Formula 3: From Area**
C = 2√(πA)
- C: Circumference
- π: Pi (3.14159...)
- A: Area

### Key Circle Relationships

- Diameter = 2 × Radius
- Area = πr²
- Circumference = π × Diameter = 2π × Radius
- For any circle: Circumference ÷ Diameter = π (always constant)

## Common Questions Answered

### What is circumference?

Circumference is the complete distance around the outer edge of a circle, equivalent to the perimeter of other shapes. It's the total length you would measure if you placed a string along the circle's edge and then straightened it out.

### Why is π (pi) important?

π is the mathematical constant that represents the ratio of any circle's circumference to its diameter. This ratio is always the same: π ≈ 3.14159. This fundamental relationship was discovered by ancient mathematicians and has fascinated mathematicians for thousands of years.

### How accurate should π be?

For most everyday calculations, π = 3.14 is sufficient. For engineering, π = 3.14159 (5 decimal places) provides accuracy to 0.00008%. Our calculator uses 15+ decimal places, which is far more accurate than needed for any practical application. NASA uses only 15 decimal places of π for interplanetary navigation.

### What units should I use?

You can use any unit of measurement (meters, feet, inches, centimeters, miles) but must be consistent. If you enter radius in centimeters, the result will be in centimeters. Always convert mixed units to a single unit before calculating.

### How do I measure circumference in real life?

- **Direct method**: Use a flexible measuring tape or string wrapped around the object. Mark where it completes one rotation and measure that length.
- **From diameter**: Measure the diameter with a ruler or tape measure, then multiply by π (3.14159).
- **From rolling**: Roll the circular object along a flat surface for one complete revolution and measure the distance traveled.
- **Using calipers**: Digital calipers provide precise diameter measurements for small objects.

### Advanced Topics

**Circumference in Motion**: When a wheel with circumference C rolls without slipping, it travels distance C with each complete rotation. This principle governs vehicle speedometers, odometers, and gear ratios.

**Arc Length**: For a portion of a circle (arc), length = (angle ÷ 360°) × C. Critical for curved paths and architectural elements.

**Rotational Speed**: Linear speed = rotational rate × circumference. This relationship governs ceiling fans, satellite orbits, and rotating machinery.
