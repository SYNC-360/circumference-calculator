## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Not appearing in ChatGPT

**Check:**
1. Is GPTBot allowed in robots.txt? ✓ Confirmed
2. Is content public? (not behind login)
3. Is page age at least 1 week? (newer pages slower to index)
4. Do you have rich, authoritative content?

**Solution:** Wait 1-2 weeks, ensure content comprehensiveness, check for any blocking rules

### Issue: Perplexity shows competitor but not you

**Check:**
1. Do you have published dates?
2. Is your content more recent/comprehensive?
3. Are you ranking in traditional search?
4. Do you have external backlinks?

**Solution:** Update content dates, add more depth, build backlinks, improve SEO

### Issue: Low citation frequency

**Check:**
1. Are your queries in AI systems?
2. Is content actually being indexed? (Check robots.txt)
3. Is E-E-A-T sufficient?
4. Are competitors stronger?

**Solution:** Improve content authority, add author credentials, build more content, enhance expertise signals
