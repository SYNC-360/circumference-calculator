  https://circumferenceofacircle.com/llms-full.txt
  ```

## Key Settings

### Current Configuration

```
‚úì Robots.txt: Allows all AI crawlers
‚úì Meta robots: "index,follow,noai"
‚úì Schema: Organization + FAQ + WebApplication
‚úì Content: Clean, well-structured markdown
```

### Important Note About "noai"

Your meta robots tag is set to `noai`, which means:
- ‚úÖ AI platforms can CITE your content (search features)
- ‚ùå AI models won't be trained on your content

**To allow training data usage**, change in `layout.tsx`:
```html
<!-- Current: -->
<meta name="robots" content="index,follow,noai" />

<!-- To allow training: -->
<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />
```

## Expected Results (30 Days)

### Realistic Metrics

| Platform | Expected Mentions | Timeline |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| **Perplexity** | 5-15/month | Week 2 |
| **ChatGPT** | 3-8/month | Week 3 |
| **Gemini** | 5-10/month | Week 2 |
| **Claude** | 3-5/month | Week 1 |
| **Others** | 2-5/month | Week 4 |

**Note:** Actual results depend on query volume, content quality, and competition.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see my site in ChatGPT yet"
- Wait 1-2 weeks (content indexing takes time)
- Verify robots.txt allows GPTBot
- Check that content is publicly accessible

### "Perplexity shows competitors but not me"
- Add more detailed examples
- Update your publish dates
- Build backlinks to improve authority
- Make content more comprehensive

### "I want to track AI mentions manually"
Try these searches:
- ChatGPT: "circumference of a circle calculator"
- Perplexity: "how do I calculate circumference"
- Claude: "C = 2œÄr formula explanation"
- Gemini: "circle circumference calculation"

## When You See Results

### You'll Know It's Working When:

1. **AI Traffic Appears in Google Analytics**
   - New referral source: "OpenAI GPT Bot"
   - Sessions from AI platform sources
   - Increased direct traffic to specific pages

2. **You Find Yourself Cited**
   - Search specific queries in each platform
   - See your domain in results
   - Note which queries bring citations

3. **Tracking Tools Show Mentions**
   - Otterly.AI dashboard shows your site
   - Monthly mention counts increase
   - Trend graphs go up

---

## One More Thing: Meta Robots Explanation

Your current setting: `<meta name="robots" content="index,follow,noai" />`

This means:
- `index` = Appear in search results ‚úì
- `follow` = Follow links on the page ‚úì
- `noai` = Don't use for AI training ‚úó (but AI search/citation OK ‚úì)

**If you change to:** `<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />`
- Allows AI models to train on your content
- Increases citation frequency
- Trade-off: Content used in AI training

**Recommended:** Keep `noai` unless your competitive advantage relies on AI visibility over training data privacy.
